# Simple LinkedIn Composer

An extremely simple LinkedIn composer for the sole purpose of crafting posts.

Try it out at [linkedin-composer.simondoescloud.com](https://linkedin-composer.simondoescloud.com/)!

## Background

LinkedIn's post composer doesn't natively allow for rich text formatting, so this tool provides a simple way to compose posts with rich text and emojis.
Tools that address custom formatting on LinkedIn are either not free or, if so, not feature-rich. This tool is completely free and open source. Do with it as you wish.

**No data leaves your browser.** Everything is stored in your browser's local storage.

## Edge Split Screen

This tool is really suitable for Edge's split screen feature to see everything side-by-side.
