## Background

LinkedIn's post composer doesn't natively allow for rich text formatting, so this tool provides a simple way to compose posts with rich text and emojis.
Tools that address custom formatting on LinkedIn are either not free or, if so, not feature-rich. This tool is completely free and open source. Do with it as you wish.
